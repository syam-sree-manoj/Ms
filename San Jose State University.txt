Q: I don't have a degree in computer science, can I be admitted? 

A: If your degree is in a related discipline (such as Information Systems), and there is space in the program, you may be be admitted conditionally, with a few extra prerequisite course requirements. If your degree is in an unrelated field, and there is space in the program, you may be asked to complete most or all undergraduate CS core courses.

Q: I took college courses in (C|C++|Java|Cobol|Perl|Unix|Oracle) programming. Do you consider these courses when evaluating my computer science background?

A: No.
